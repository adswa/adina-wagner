I have bouquet of emotions when it comes to giving talks.
It is *a lot* of fun. I enjoy speaking about things I'm passionate about.
It is also absolutely horrifying.
Even after years of practice with talks and multi-day workshops, I still spend the week prior to a talk sleepless with every possible worry.
And of course (hello there, [Impostor Syndrome](https://phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1972)!) it keeps being a surprise to be asked to give a talk.
Whenever it happens, a mix of pride, self-doubt, joy, fear, and the thought 'is the sender really sure they sent this to the right person?' makes me [stare at the email in careful disbelief](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/brain_compliments) with a [freeze response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing_behavior) for a few hours.

So to my continuing surprise, horror, and joy, I got to give many talks about things I am passionate about over the years.
And I'm usually incredibly happy if they get recorded (actually thanks, Pandemic!), because then I can also get to see them once my adrenaline rush went by.

If you are interested in talks I gave, you can usually find all my slides on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q=Adina%20S.%20Wagner&access_right=open&type=presentation) and their sources [GitHub](https://github.com/adswa).
And if you search for it, you can find recordings of many of them on YouTube.
A selection from various sources is below:


### Reproducibility management in Neuroscience

Receiving the invitation to the DGPA/DGPs-Symposium "Computational Reproducibility" was my most memorable *please wait while I hyperventilate* experience so far.
I learned - from the response email after accepting the casual "hey how about you come give a short talk it might be fun" invitation - that one of my biggest scientific heroes would give a talk as well.
That email found me while I was on a train ride, and I almost missed my stop because I couldn't move for a while.

### Follow the rabbits: The 2020 OHBM Brainhack Traintrack Session on DataLad

This video is a DataLad tutorial for the OHBM Brainhack, but it contains bunnies as clickbait:

### DataLad - Decentralized Management of Digital Objects for Open Science

I was proud to represent the DataLad project, which I hadn't been a part of for too long at the time, at the DebConf (the Debian Conference).
I was also excited to play with [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) for the first time when creating this video.

### Version Control for data and beyond

I believe version control makes science better. This talk gave me the chance to outline many reasons why.

### all things version control and DataLad workshops

I've given quite a few tutorials and workshops.
You will find a few on the [DataLad YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/datalad), but the one below is from the ABCD-ReproNim Course.
