Its not immediately straightforward how to not only share code and data easily, but also allow others to build your complete scientific manuscript from scratch.
But it can be easy if you know how.

One way it can be done is using DataLad, LaTeX, and Makefiles. 
The result is a publicly shared GitHub repository that allows a complete recomputation and manuscript regeneration with a single command: [github.com/psychoinformatics-de/paper-remodnav](https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/paper-remodnav/).

Read about the details in complete write-up in the [DataLad Handbook](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/usecases/reproducible-paper.html) and [slides](https://github.com/datalad-handbook/course/blob/master/talks/PDFs/reproduciblepaper_INM7seminar_wagner.pdf) from a presentation about it.
